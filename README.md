# OS-Lab

Handle with care.

If it doesn't work, text me. If it does work, congratulate me. If it doesn't run, you have typed the wrong code. If it has compilation errors, you're probably trying to run a linux code in windows.


Edit 1: I'm lazy. So the last few codes that i uploaded may not (will not) work. Navaneeth has edited a few codes in this repo, but i don't trust him, and neither should you.
PS. I'll try to complete this thing before the next lab.
